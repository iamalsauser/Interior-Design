### **🏗️ Architecture Implementation**

#### **MVVM Pattern**
- **Model**: ARModel struct for data representation
- **View**: ContentView with SwiftUI interface
- **ViewModel**: ARViewModel with ObservableObject and Combine

#### **Combine Integration**
- `@Published var selectedModelName: String`
- `@Published var isPlacementMode: Bool`
- `@Published var placedModels: [ARModel]`
- Reactive UI updates throughout the app

#### **ARKit Integration**
- `UIViewRepresentable` wrapper for ARView
- World tracking with plane detection
- Raycast-based surface detection
- Light estimation and occlusion support
